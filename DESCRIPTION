Description: 
    This is my implementation of the a next word predicting and text generation. 
    This is not a Katz's Back-off model, but it is inspired by it, more over, 
    this is not a stupid back-off either. This can be used to train and evaluate 
    you models, aswell as predict new text from an input text.
